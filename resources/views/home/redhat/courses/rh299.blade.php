         <h4 class="blue">Course Overview</h4>
         <p>During the 4-day course, students will work at their own pace through the complete set of labs from both the RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) Rapid Track course (RH199) and Red Hat System Administration III (RH254). The RHCE Certification Lab course includes a few instructor lectures designed to review key technologies such as systemd, firewalld, and IPv6. For the classroom and virtual classroom versions of this course, an instructor will be available throughout the week to assist students as they work through the labs.</p>
